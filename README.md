# Assembler Project

The Assembler Project is a C project that aims to create a new assembler for a specific architecture. The project involves developing a program that translates assembly language code into machine code instructions that can be executed by the target architecture.

## Project Goals

- Develop a robust and efficient assembler program.
- Support a wide range of assembly language instructions.
- Handle various addressing modes and data types.
- Implement error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- Optimize the translation process for improved performance.

## Project Structure

The project will consist of multiple modules and components, including:

- Lexer: Responsible for tokenizing the assembly code.
- Parser: Parses the tokens and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Symbol Table: Manages symbols and their associated addresses.
- Code Generator: Translates the AST into machine code instructions.
- Error Handler: Detects and reports any syntax or semantic errors.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Standard C libraries
- Development tools (e.g., IDE, compiler, debugger)

## Project Timeline

- Milestone 1: Setup project structure and basic functionality.
- Milestone 2: Implement lexer and parser modules.
- Milestone 3: Develop symbol table and code generator.
- Milestone 4: Implement error handling and testing.
- Milestone 5: Optimize performance and finalize documentation.
